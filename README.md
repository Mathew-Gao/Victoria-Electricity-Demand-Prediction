# Predicting Electricity Demand in Victoria

This is a predictive analytics project that aims to build a model for predicting electricity demand in Victoria, Australia. The project uses half-hourly electricity demand and price data from the Victorian electricity market, as well as weather data from Melbourne Airport, over the period of January 2018 to June 2022. The goal is to construct a predictive model that provides accurate point forecasts and expected maximum demand predictions, while addressing specific issues related to electricity demand and its influencing factors.

# Files

The following files are included in this project:

**AEMO_electricity.csv**: 
a CSV file containing the half-hourly electricity demand and price data from the Victorian electricity market.

**MELAIR_weather.csv**: a CSV file containing the half-hourly weather data from Melbourne Airport.

**Electricity Usage Prediction.Rmd**: an R Markdown file containing the code and analysis for the project.

**Electricity Demand Prediction Report**: a pfd file reports the process and results for this project.

# Cleaning the Data

Before building the predictive model, the data had to be cleaned and processed to remove any missing or irrelevant data points, and to merge the electricity demand and weather data sets.

# Analytical/Modeling Process

The modeling process involved analyzing the exploratory data features, building and selecting appropriate models for point forecasts and maximum demand forecasts, and assessing the forecast accuracy.

# Results

The key results of the project are summarized in the report submitted includes the point forecasts and expected maximum demand predictions for the week of July 1-7, 2022. The report includes relevant statistics and tables that aid the discussion of the issues and exploratory data features, as well as the technical analysis and model selection.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, this project aimed to build a predictive model for electricity demand in Victoria that addresses specific issues related to demand and its influencing factors. The project used half-hourly electricity demand and weather data, and involved a cleaning process, analytical and modeling process, and result assessment. The final report summarizes the key results and provides insights into the outlook of the predicted demand for the week of July 1-7, 2022.
